* rde
Set of tools for managing computing environments with GNU Guix. More
info is available on [[http://trop.in][trop.in]].

*Disclaimer:* project in a proof of concept stage.

*Tip:* older Nix source code is available under ~stale/~ directory.

~guix home~'s [[./gnu/README][README]] for very curious people.

** Principles
*** Main
- Ergonomic :: Sane keybindings, good contrast, readable fonts.
- Reproducible :: Setup can be easily replicated.
- Hackable :: Easy to throw out or modify any part of setup.
- Stateless :: All state must be explicit and syncable or temporary.
*** Secondary
- Lightweight and battery efficient :: wayland, fast native apps.
- Offline :: most of workflows and apps should work without network.
- Attention-friendly :: minimal use of notification and other
  distractive things.
** Community
